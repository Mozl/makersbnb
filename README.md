### Project: Make a clone of AirBnB

Our group: Louis, Dan, Lorraine and Gadiza

#### Day 1

We use Trello to keep an eye on our progress, set up ground rules, working hours and rotate pairing and meetings.

We will be using JavaScript for this project.

To get the MVP(The smallest thing that implements the core idea.), we decided to start with one user story:

##### User Story 1

As a user, so I can decide where to stay, I'd like to view a list of properties.

This is going to be our MVP (a hardcoded website page with the properties and contact details). 

One group will be making the HTML file with hard coded properties with contact details and the other group will be looking how to implement the database with JavaScript for later.
